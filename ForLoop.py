"""
Python For Loops
A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence 
(that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set,
 or a string).
 works more like an 
iterator method as found in other object-orientated
programming languages.

With the for loop we can execute a set of statements, 
once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc.

# for createAvariable in  iterating:
# fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

# for x in fruits:
#     print()

 
# fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

# for x in fruits:
#   if x == "banana":
#     continue
#   print(x)



"""The range() Function
To loop through a set of code a specified number of times,
 we can use the range() function,
The range() function returns a sequence of numbers, 
starting from 0 by default, and increments by 1 (by default), and ends at a specified number.

# for x in range(8):
#     print(x)

# for x in range(6):

# else:
#   print("Finally finished!")

# for x in range(6):
